The methods presented in [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) and [SimCLRv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029) demonstrated great success in training computer vision models at classification tasks. The focus of this project is to determine if the same techniques can be applied to multi-spectral satellite imagery with similar success.
