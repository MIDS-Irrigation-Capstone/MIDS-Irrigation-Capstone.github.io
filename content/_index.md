Leveraging large unlabeled datasets as been a challenge for the computer vision community up until recent advances were made with SimCLR, MoCo and Facebooks SEER models. For this Captsone project we implement the SOTA SimCLRv2 methodology of training a large computer vision model to later be utilized in the fine-tuning task of detecting irrigated patches of land from satellite images.
