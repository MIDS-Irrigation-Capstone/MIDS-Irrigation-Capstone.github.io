These models introduce a new dataset (California) which is completely unlabeled as the starting point to train a computer vision model.</description></item><item><title>Baseline Models</title><link>https://mids-irrigation-capstone.github.io/models/supervised_baseline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mids-irrigation-capstone.github.io/models/supervised_baseline/</guid><description>The goal of this project is to identify if self-supervised learning is a viable option when training on satellite imagery with limited access to labeled data. Our baseline models are trained on a variety of neural network architectures and fractions of labeled data to quantify the performance impact as our fraction of labeled data changes. We will used the results of our baseline models to assess the performance of our self-supervised models with the constraints.</description></item></channel></rss>
