Experiment 1 Supervised model with various splits of labeled data. For the first set of experiments we used only the &amp;ldquo;permanently irrigated&amp;rdquo; label for classification, which is only a small fraction of the dataset at roughly 2.3%. We explore models commonly trained with the ImageNet dataset, and several ResNet models of different sizes, on ever diminishing splits of our labeled dataset.</description></item></channel></rss>
